This project incorperates Semantic UI into a developer theme for WordPress. This
project also includes some of my favorite techniques for creating fast,
responsive, and easy-to-maintain themes for WordPress. *Please keep in mind this
theme is meant to be developed for your specific application; and is not meant to
be used "as-is."*

## Installation

#### Requirements

* PHP 5.4 or later
* WordPress 3.9.0 or later

#### Install Guide

1. Download the release version of the theme
2. Unzip to your `wp-content/themes` directory
3. Set the theme to "active" in your WordPress dashboard

Please notice that when you are building from source, as described below, you should run the build process at least once before activating the theme. This will garantuee that the theme file are loaded from `/build` and not from `/src`.

#### Building From Source

To build from source you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed
and in your `$path` ([win](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)/[mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119125/mac-os-x-mavericks-add-to-path)/[unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26047/how-to-correctly-add-a-path-to-path)).
You should also have [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed and in your `$path` as well.

**Mac &amp; Unix:**

1. Download or clone the master branch
2. Open your command line and navigate to where you deployed the code
3. Run `sudo npm install && sudo npm install -g gulp` enter your password and then wait for it to finish.
4. Run `gulp` to see a list of available tasks. Running `gulp build` will regenerate `/build` from scratch.

**Windows:**

1. Download or clone the master branch
2. Open your command line and navigate to where you deployed the code
3. Run `npm install && npm install -g gulp` and then wait for it to finish.
4. Run `gulp` to see a list of available tasks. Running `gulp build` will regenerate `/build` from scratch.

## Usage

This is a developer theme designed to be developed for your specific application.
The default state of this theme is meant to be plain &amp; organized; while not
being bias to any particular design. (thus everything defaults to black and
white)

## Designing Pages

In this developer theme there are 5 important parts to generate a page:

- Templates
- Includes
- Layouts
- Contents
- Assets

**A template file** decides which layout to use based on the type of content
that is being requested. A template file will typically have no HTML or very
little HTML, but should get all the necessary includes for the page.

**A include file** adds functionality to a page and should have no output unless
a function or method is called in a template, layout, or content file. Include
files are usually used for API classes and libararies, but can be used for
anything related to functionality.

**A layout file** decides where sidebars and other content is inserted. Layout
files should usually have a fair or large amount of HTML content, as well as a
few functionality calls; such as calling a comments thread or specific form to
be generated. The header and footer is usually inserted via the layout file.

**A content file** generates a group of elements and often has functionality
calls for specifc elements, such as dynamic text and images. Content files
typically output the most text, and usually have a large amount of HTML.

**Assets** are typically static files that are commonly used. These files are
usually images, stylesheets, fonts, and javascript files, and might also
include other files that need to be precompiled before they can be used. (such
as LESS and SASS/SCSS files)
