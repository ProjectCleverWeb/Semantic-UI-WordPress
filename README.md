This project incorporates Semantic UI into a starter (aka developer) theme for WordPress. This project also includes some useful techniques for creating fast, responsive, and easy-to-maintain themes for WordPress. *Please keep in mind this theme is meant to be developed for your specific application; and is not meant to be used "as-is."*

## Installation

#### Requirements

* PHP **5.6**, **7.0**, or **HHVM** <small>(5.4 and 5.5 run, but are not officially supported)</small>
* WordPress 4.0 or later <small>(3.9 runs, but is not officially supported)</small>

#### Install Guide

1. Download the release version of the theme
2. Unzip to your `wp-content/themes` directory
3. Set the theme to "active" in your WordPress dashboard

Please notice that when you are building from source, as described below, you should run the build process at least once before activating the theme. This will garantuee that the theme file are loaded from `/build` and not from `/src`.

#### Building From Source

To build from source you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed
and in your `$path` ([win](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)/[mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119125/mac-os-x-mavericks-add-to-path)/[unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26047/how-to-correctly-add-a-path-to-path)).
You should also have [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed and in your `$path` as well.

&#42;&#42;Please note that when building from source, the `/dist` directory
should be renamed and then put in your `/wp-content/themes` directory

**Mac &amp; Unix:**

1. Download or clone the master branch
2. Open your command line and navigate to where you deployed the code
3. Run `npm install && sudo npm install -g gulp` enter your password and then wait for it to finish.
4. Run `gulp` to see a list of available tasks. Running `gulp build` will regenerate `/dist` from scratch.

**Windows:**

1. Download or clone the master branch
2. Open your command line and navigate to where you deployed the code
3. Run `npm install && npm install -g gulp` and then wait for it to finish.
4. Run `gulp` to see a list of available tasks. Running `gulp build` will regenerate `/dist` from scratch.

## Usage

This is a developer theme designed to be developed for your specific application. The default state of this theme is meant to be minimal &amp; organized; while not being bias to any particular design.

## Designing Pages

In this developer theme there are 4 important parts to generate a page:

- Templates
- Includes
- Contents
- Assets

**A template file** generates the general layout of a page. They generally call
the header and footer functions, get content files, and should call any includes
the page will need.

**A include file** adds functionality to a page and should have no output unless
a function or method is called in a template or content file. Include files are 
usually used for API classes and libraries, but can be used for any kind of
functionality.

**A content file** generates a group of elements and often has functionality
calls for specific elements, such as dynamic text and images. Content files
typically output the most HTML.

**Assets** are typically static files that are commonly used. These files are
usually images, stylesheets, fonts, and javascript files, and might also
include other files that need to be pre-compiled before they can be used. (such
as LESS and SASS/SCSS files)
